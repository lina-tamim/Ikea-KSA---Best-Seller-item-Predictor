# Ikea KSA Best-Seller-item-Predictor
This project focuses on creating a classification model to predict future best sellers. We cover the entire process, including web scraping for data collection, dataset exploration, preprocessing, and EDA. We evaluate three classification models (SVM, Logistic Regression, KNN) and provide visualizations to answer key questions.
